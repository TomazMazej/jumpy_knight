## Description
Jumpy Knight is a free 2D pixel runner game where you are constantly on the move. Run and jump over the enemies while collecting gold and treasure chests to unlock new faster characters which can jump higher. There is always a gold coin somewhere on the map to be collected. The chest spawns every 30 seconds after pickup. The goal is to survive as long as possible and watch your score rise.

Story:
The evil dark knights have invaded the kingdom after 300 years. They have already conquered dozens of other kingdoms. You and the other brave knights met them in the open field to protect your king and the castle but you were outnumbered ten to one! You are the last knight standing! Unfortunately you have lost your sword in the battle. All you can do now is to become a jumpy knight and jump over your enemies to ensure your SURVIVAL!
Oh and don't forget to pick up all the gold and treasure on your way!
